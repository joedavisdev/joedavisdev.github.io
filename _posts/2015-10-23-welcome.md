I've realised it would be handy to have a website to call my own, so I put some time aside to create this beaut. Initially I wrote a site from scratch with Bootstrap, but realised that was a really slow and clunky way of solving the problem. I've taken the easy way out and customised a popular Jekyll theme called [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/). I may move the handful of blog posts from my barren Wordpress blog here. Hopefully, having my projects listed in the same site as my blog will encourage me to write more about them!
