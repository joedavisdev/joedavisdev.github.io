I decided a few weeks ago to put the development of my Deified renderer on hold. The aim of the project was to help me understand how Apple's Metal graphics API compares to OpenGL ES (and Vulkan, as I've been learning that during my day job). I feel like I've achieved that goal, but spent too much time focusing on my explicit graphics API abstraction layer than the Metal API itself. As time is always limited for personal projects (and I was considering rewriting the abstraction layer again...), putting the project to one side and spending my time on something else seems like the best idea.

I've been playing around with Unity, so might try to release a small game off the back of that. Maybe I'll write a few standalone Metal rendering demos after. Whatever I end up doing, I'll aim to post more frequent updates here :)
